# Hello, there! ✌️

My name is Iago Rodrigues, and I am a full-stack web development student from Rio de Janeiro.
I am currently studying **Análise e Desenvolvimento de Sistemas** and taking a **Fullstack Developer** course.

I love creating modern, responsive, functional, and visually appealing websites and applications.
I am constantly learning and improving my skills to become a great developer.
